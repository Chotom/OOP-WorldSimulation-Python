# OOP_WorldSimulation_Python
Desktop application that simulate life of organisms on board. Created as OOP learing process in python with tkinter. <br>
It is extended version of [this project](https://github.com/Chotom/OOP_WorldSimulation_C)  written in C++<br>

#### Tkinter
Tkinter module is required due to GUI mode. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, 
as well as on Windows systems.
Running ```python -m tkinter``` from the command line should open a window demonstrating a simple Tk interface, 
letting you know that Tkinter is properly installed on your system, and also showing what version of Tcl/Tk is installed, so you can read the Tcl/Tk documentation specific to that version.
